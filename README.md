oh-my-logo-CJK transforms Chinese, Japanese, and Korean text into pixel-style ASCII art directly in your command line. It uses various gradient color palettes for a visually appealing output.

### Key Features:
- **CJK Compatibility**: Supports multiple languages by sampling pixel fonts, not pre-made ASCII.
- **Rich Color Support**: Utilizes a range of gradient palettes, featuring 24-bit ANSI colors.
- **Flexibility**: Offers various pixel output modes and styles (half/full, block/shade).
- **Cross-Platform Ready**: Works out of the box on Windows with `colorama` for ANSI compatibility.
